'''
i'd like to register a complaint about the new website redesign
two commony used pages were broken
/WeeklyPhoenix
and
/i-am-a/current-student.php
the first is the default page on the lab computers
the second probably got bookmarked by 20% of students
suggestions:
1. redirect these pages to their newer counterparts
(/i-am-a/current-student.php -> /myfloridapoly/ and i don't know where the weekly phoenix is now)
2. put a note on the page that it's moved instead of a 404 not found
3. change the firefox start page to the correct weekly phoenix page

print(id(a))
a = 7
b = a
print(id(b))
